BART is an ART application written in Ruby on Rails and is intended as a web front end for OpenMRS for supporting Malawi's ART system. 
OpenMRSÂ® is a community-developed, open-source, enterprise electronic medical record system framework. We've come together to specifically respond to those actively building and managing health systems in the developing world, where AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria afflict the lives of millions. Our mission is to foster self-sustaining health information technology implementations in these environments through peer mentorship, proactive collaboration, and a code base that equals or surpasses proprietary equivalents. You are welcome to come participate in the community, whether by implementing our software, or contributing your efforts to our mission!

                        password: your_database_password
                        host: localhost
                        pool: 500
      development:
                       adapter: mysql
                       database: your_database_name
                       username: your_database_username
                       password: your_database_passwor
                       host: localhost

                       host: localhost
                       pool: 500


Save and close the database.yml file.


Using your editor open the application.yml file and make sure it looks something like the following:

       healthdata:

                       use.user.selected.activities: yes
